**Data Collection Library**

Every customer facing application generates huge amount of data, which can be inferred to customer behaviors, shopping trends, performance reviews, performance flaws, etc.
This makes data collection an important aspect of today's ecommerce web applications. We can try to standardize and program data collection as an aspect so that it is least interfering with the existing pieces of implementation. With minimal effort we should be able to configure it, switch it on and off and expand it whenever situation arises.

**Features**

_list of features expected to be there in the plugin._

- Ability to seamlessly integrate with Existing Data Layer API.  
- Ability to configure what data needs to collected and when it has to be collected.  
- Ability to selectively switch data collection on or off based on configuration.  
- Custom library specific logging which can be switched on and off.  
- Ability to have optional cache management.  
- Ability to extend the core functionality.  
- It should work with both legacy and contemporary applications.  
- The library should not be dependent on any other library except JQuery. It should autonomous. It can be developed as a JQuery plugin as well.  

**Research Prerequisites**

_This section would list down all the research tasks needed to be exercised before the detailed requirement and design kicks off._

- Object oriented JavaScript fundamentals.  
- Understanding of interceptors in JQuery library and Angular framework.  
- Understanding of promises in JQuery library and Angular framework.  
- Understanding of event binding, event queuing and event management.  
- Cross browser event management.
